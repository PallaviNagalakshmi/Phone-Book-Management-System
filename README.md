 # 📞 Phone Book Management System

  The **Phone Book Management System** is a C-based command-line application designed to efficiently **organize and manage contact information** using dynamic data structures.

  This project uses **singly linked lists** to dynamically manage memory allocation, enabling the application to handle a variable number of contacts without predefined limits. This makes the system **scalable**, **efficient**, and well-suited for both personal and organizational use.

  Its modular structure and clear logic make it ideal for beginners learning C and data structures, while still offering robust functionality for more advanced users.
